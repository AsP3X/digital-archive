Prompt for Claude-3.5-Sonnet:

"You are an expert software architect tasked with designing a tech stack for a digital archive website. The website must be built using Next.js with a component-based architecture and should support storing and displaying text and images. It requires user login and registration functionality, as well as a contact form for user inquiries. Provide a detailed tech stack plan, including frontend and backend technologies, database choices, file storage solutions, authentication methods, and deployment strategies. Break it down into sections (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Features, DevOps) and suggest specific tools, libraries, or services with justifications for each choice. Include a sample file structure and considerations for scalability. Keep the response concise yet comprehensive, focusing on modern, practical solutions suitable for a Next.js application as of March 2025."

This prompt is structured to elicit a detailed, actionable response from Claude, mirroring the style and depth I provided earlier. It specifies the requirements clearly and encourages justification for choices, which aligns with Claude's strengths in reasoning and explanation. Let me know if you'd like to tweak it further!
